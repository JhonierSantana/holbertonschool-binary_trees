<h1 align="center"> THE BINARY TREES PROJECT 👨🏻‍💻 🌳 👩🏻‍💻  </h1>

##### ¿What is the Binary Trees? Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

## Data Structures 💻
###### The important terms with respect to tree.

| Important Terms  | Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  Path |  Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree. |
| Root  | The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.  |
| Parent   | Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.  |
| Child  | The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.  |
|  Leaf |   The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node. |
|  Subtree | Subtree represents the descendants of a node.  |
|  Visiting  |  Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node. |
| Traversing  |  Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order. |
| Levels  |  Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on. |
| keys  |  Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node. |

## BST Basic Operations 📌

| Basic operations  |  Description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Insert  |  Inserts an element in a tree/create a tree. |
| Search  | Searches an element in a tree.  |
| Preorder Traversal  | Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.  |
| Inorder Traversal  | Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.  |
| Postorder Traversal  | Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.  |
